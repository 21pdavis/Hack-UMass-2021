Can you help me with my GPS? I need directions to find my way into your heart.
Are you a Subaru? Cuz you Impreza me alot. 
Since gas prices are so high, I think you should carpool with me to dinner tonight.
I'm lost, can you tell me which road leads to your heart?
Did it hurt when they manufactured you in heaven?
Do you drive here often?
Are you petroleum? Because without you, I can't move forward.
If you were a car, I'd check your oil regularly.
Girl, if you were a race car. You'd be lightning McQueen.
I'd drive a million miles for one of your smiles.
Do you believe in love at first sight? Or should I drive by again? 
Looking good, hot rod. 
Are you a spark plug? Because without you my life can't start.
Are you a high beam? Because when you walk in, my life gets brighter.
